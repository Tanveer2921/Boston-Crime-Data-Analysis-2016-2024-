Boston Crime Patterns Dashboard (2016–2024)
Project Overview

This project presents an interactive crime dashboard analyzing Boston crime patterns from 2016 to 2024. The dashboard was designed as a storytelling and decision-support tool for law enforcement officers, public safety leaders, and community members.

Rather than focusing solely on crime counts, the dashboard reveals when, where, and what types of crimes occur, helping stakeholders understand trends, allocate resources effectively, and improve community safety.

The project emphasizes data-driven storytelling, combining time-based trends, geographic analysis, and interactive filters to support proactive decision-making.

Project Goals

Identify temporal crime patterns across years, months, and weekdays

Highlight high-crime police districts for targeted intervention

Visualize geographic clustering of major crime types

Enable interactive exploration for police officers and the public

Support strategic planning and crime prevention efforts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dashboard Narrative Structure

The dashboard follows a top-down storytelling approach, guiding users from broad trends to localized insights:

Time Trends – How crime changes over years and days

District Analysis – Which police districts are most impacted

Seasonal & Weekly Patterns – When crime peaks occur

Geographic Clustering – Where major crimes concentrate

This structure allows users to move from general patterns to specific action areas.

 Key Visualizations & Insights
 Stacked Bar Chart: Year × Day of Week

Shows crime trends across years and weekdays

Clear dip in 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdowns

Sharp increase in 2023–2024

Saturdays consistently record the highest incident counts, identifying weekends as critical risk periods

 Bar Chart by Police District

Highlights districts with the highest crime volumes

B2, C11, and D4 consistently report the most incidents

Supports patrol prioritization, resource allocation, and community engagement planning

 Heatmap: Month × Weekday

Reveals seasonal and weekday crime peaks

July and August emerge as high-risk months

Tuesdays and Fridays show elevated crime levels

Provides actionable insights for shift scheduling, event planning, and outreach initiatives

 Crime Map: Major Crime Types

Focuses on five high-impact crime categories:

Assault

Drug Violations

Alcohol-Related Offenses

Larceny

Vandalism

The map highlights crime clustering across districts, supporting:

Area-specific policing strategies

Public safety interventions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Community awareness and prevention programs

 Interactive Filters

The dashboard includes global filters that apply across all visuals:

Year

Police District

Crime Type

These filters allow:

Police officers to analyze trends within their assigned districts

City leaders to compare years and crime categories

Community members to explore neighbourhood-level safety patterns

The interactivity transforms the dashboard into a customizable, user-driven experience.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Visual Design & Gestalt Principles

The dashboard applies key visual design and Gestalt principles to ensure clarity and usability:

Proximity: Related charts grouped together

Alignment: Consistent layout using containers

Color Consistency: Uniform color schemes for crime types and time-based values

Visual Hierarchy: Filters at the top; key trends flow left-to-right, top-to-bottom

Whitespace: Reduces clutter and improves readability

These design choices enhance comprehension and decision-making efficiency.

What the Dashboard Reveals

This dashboard demonstrates that crime in Boston follows identifiable patterns rather than occurring randomly:

Crime declined sharply in 2020, likely due to reduced mobility and lockdowns

A significant increase in 2023–2024 suggests a return to or surpassing of pre-pandemic levels

Weekends, particularly Saturdays, pose higher risk

Certain districts experience consistently higher crime volumes

Seasonal and weekday spikes highlight opportunities for targeted intervention

For police officers, the dashboard supports strategic deployment and operational planning.
For residents, it improves public awareness and community engagement.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data visualization and storytelling can transform complex crime data into actionable insights. By combining temporal analysis, geographic mapping, and interactive filtering, the dashboard empowers law enforcement and communities to better understand crime dynamics and respond more effectively.

The approach highlights the value of proactive, data-informed public safety strategies that benefit both officers and residents alike.
